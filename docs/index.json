This is greater than the current estimated age of the universe.\n\nThe range of a duration requires the storage of a number larger than a `long`.\nTo achieve this, the class stores a `long` representing seconds and an `int`\nrepresenting nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.\n\nThe duration is measured in \"seconds\", but these are not necessarily identical to\nthe scientific \"SI second\" definition based on atomic clocks.\nThis difference only impacts durations measured near a leap-second and should not affect\nmost applications.\nSee {@link Instant} for a discussion as to the meaning of the second and time-scales.\n\n### Static properties of Class {@link Duration}\n\nDuration.ZERO\n\nConstant for a duration of zero.",

The length of an SI second was defined\n * to be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.\n *\n * Unfortunately, as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.\n * In addition, over time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.\n * As a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.\n * The actual length of any given day and the amount by which the Earth is slowing\n * are not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.\n * The UT1 time-scale captures the accurate length of day, but is only available some\n * time after the day has completed.\n *\n * The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions\n * of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as *leap-seconds*.\n * A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.\n * As such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401 SI seconds where\n * necessary in order to keep the day aligned with the Sun.\n *\n * The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.\n * Between 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and\n * alterations to the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway\n * to change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove leap seconds or\n * introduce other changes.\n *\n * Given the complexity of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines\n * its own time-scale, the *Java Time-Scale*.\n *\n * The Java Time-Scale divides each calendar day into exactly 86400\n * subdivisions, known as seconds.  These seconds may differ from the\n * SI second.  It closely matches the de facto international civil time\n * scale, the definition of which changes from time to time.\n *\n * The Java Time-Scale has slightly different definitions for different\n * segments of the time-line, each based on the consensus international\n * time scale that is used as the basis for civil time. Whenever the\n * internationally-agreed time scale is modified or replaced, a new\n * segment of the Java Time-Scale must be defined for it.  Each segment\n * must meet these requirements:\n *\n * * the Java Time-Scale shall closely match the underlying international\n *   civil time scale;\n * * the Java Time-Scale shall exactly match the international civil\n *   time scale at noon each day;\n * * the Java Time-Scale shall have a precisely-defined relationship to\n *   the international civil time scale.\n *\n * There are currently, as of 2013, two segments in the Java time-scale.\n *\n * For the segment from 1972-11-03 (exact boundary discussed below) until\n * further notice, the consensus international time scale is UTC (with\n * leap seconds).  In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is identical to\n * [UTC-SLS](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/).\n * This is identical to UTC on days that do not have a leap second.\n * On days that do have a leap second, the leap second is spread equally\n * over the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining the appearance of\n * exactly 86400 seconds per day.\n *\n * For the segment prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,\n * the consensus international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied\n * proleptically, which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the\n * prime meridian (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is\n * identical to the consensus international time scale. The exact\n * boundary between the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC\n * between 1972-11-03T00:00 and 1972-11-04T12:00.\n *\n * Implementations of the Java time-scale using the JSR-310 API are not\n * required to provide any clock that is sub-second accurate, or that\n * progresses monotonically or smoothly. Implementations are therefore\n * not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to otherwise be\n * aware of leap seconds. JSR-310 does, however, require that\n * implementations must document the approach they use when defining a\n * clock representing the current instant.\n * See {@link Clock} for details on the available clocks.\n *\n * The Java time-scale is used for all date-time classes.\n * This includes {@link Instant}, {@link LocalDate}, {@link LocalTime}, {@link OffsetDateTime},\n * {@link ZonedDateTime} and {@link Duration}.\n *\n * ### Static properties of Class {@link Instant}\n *\n * Instant.EPOCH\n *\n * Instant.MIN\n *\n * Instant.MAX\n *\n * Instant.MIN_SECONDS\n *\n * Instant.MAX_SECONDS\n *\n */\nexport class Instant extends Temporal {\n\n    /**\n     * Obtains the current instant from the system clock, or if specified\n     * the current instant from the specified clock.\n     *\n     * This will query the specified clock to obtain the current time.\n     *\n     * @param {Clock} [clock=Clock.systemUTC()] -

    "description": "An instantaneous point on the time-line.\n\nThis class models a single instantaneous point on the time-line.\nThis might be used to record event time-stamps in the application.\n\nTime-scale\n\nThe length of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.\nThis has traditionally been subdivided into 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds,\nforming a 86400 second day.\n\nModern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks which precisely define an SI second\nrelative to the transitions of a Caesium atom. The length of an SI second was defined\nto be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.\n\nUnfortunately, as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.\nIn addition, over time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.\nAs a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.\nThe actual length of any given day and the amount by which the Earth is slowing\nare not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.\nThe UT1 time-scale captures the accurate length of day, but is only available some\ntime after the day has completed.\n\nThe UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions\nof a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as *leap-seconds*.\nA leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.\nAs such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401 SI seconds where\nnecessary in order to keep the day aligned with the Sun.\n\nThe modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.\nBetween 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and\nalterations to the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway\nto change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove leap seconds or\nintroduce other changes.\n\nGiven the complexity of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines\nits own time-scale, the *Java Time-Scale*.\n\nThe Java Time-Scale divides each calendar day into exactly 86400\nsubdivisions, known as seconds.  These seconds may differ from the\nSI second.  It closely matches the de facto international civil time\nscale, the definition of which changes from time to time.\n\nThe Java Time-Scale has slightly different definitions for different\nsegments of the time-line, each based on the consensus international\ntime scale that is used as the basis for civil time. Whenever the\ninternationally-agreed time scale is modified or replaced, a new\nsegment of the Java Time-Scale must be defined for it.  Each segment\nmust meet these requirements:\n\n* the Java Time-Scale shall closely match the underlying international\n  civil time scale;\n* the Java Time-Scale shall exactly match the international civil\n  time scale at noon each day;\n* the Java Time-Scale shall have a precisely-defined relationship to\n  the international civil time scale.\n\nThere are currently, as of 2013, two segments in the Java time-scale.\n\nFor the segment from 1972-11-03 (exact boundary discussed below) until\nfurther notice, the consensus international time scale is UTC (with\nleap seconds).  In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is identical to\n[UTC-SLS](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/).\nThis is identical to UTC on days that do not have a leap second.\nOn days that do have a leap second, the leap second is spread equally\nover the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining the appearance of\nexactly 86400 seconds per day.\n\nFor the segment prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,\nthe consensus international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied\nproleptically, which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the\nprime meridian (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is\nidentical to the consensus international time scale. The exact\nboundary between the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC\nbetween 1972-11-03T00:00 and 1972-11-04T12:00.\n\nImplementations of the Java time-scale using the JSR-310 API are not\nrequired to provide any clock that is sub-second accurate, or that\nprogresses monotonically or smoothly. Implementations are therefore\nnot required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to otherwise be\naware of leap seconds. JSR-310 does, however, require that\nimplementations must document the approach they use when defining a\nclock representing the current instant.\nSee {@link Clock} for details on the available clocks.\n\nThe Java time-scale is used for all date-time classes.\nThis includes {@link Instant}, {@link LocalDate}, {@link LocalTime}, {@link OffsetDateTime},\n{@link ZonedDateTime} and {@link Duration}.\n\n### Static properties of Class {@link Instant}\n\nInstant.EPOCH\n\nInstant.MIN\n\nInstant.MAX\n\nInstant.MIN_SECONDS\n\nInstant.MAX_SECONDS",

If the day-of-year is invalid for the\n  year, then a {@link DateTimeException} is thrown.\n* {@link EPOCH_DAY} -\n  Returns a {@link LocalDate} with the specified epoch-day.\n  This completely replaces the date and is equivalent to {@link ofEpochDay}.\n* {@link ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} -\n  Returns a {@link LocalDate} with the specified aligned-week-of-month.\n  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given month starts\n  on the first day of that month.\n  This adjustment moves the date in whole week chunks to match the specified week.\n  The result will have the same day-of-week as this date.\n  This may cause the date to be moved into the following month.\n* {@link ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR} -\n  Returns a {@link LocalDate} with the specified aligned-week-of-year.\n  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given year starts\n  on the first day of that year.\n  This adjustment moves the date in whole week chunks to match the specified week.\n  The result will have the same day-of-week as this date.\n  This may cause the date to be moved into the following year.\n* {@link MONTH_OF_YEAR} -\n  Returns a {@link LocalDate} with the specified month-of-year.\n  The year will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,\n  unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the\n  day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.\n* {@link PROLEPTIC_MONTH} -\n  Returns a {@link LocalDate} with the specified proleptic-month.\n  The day-of-month will be unchanged, unless it would be invalid for the new month\n  and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value\n  for the new month and year.\n* {@link YEAR_OF_ERA} -\n  Returns a {@link LocalDate} with the specified year-of-era.\n  The era and month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,\n  unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the\n  day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.\n* {@link YEAR} -\n  Returns a {@link LocalDate} with the specified year.\n  The month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,\n  unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the\n  day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.\n* {@link ERA} -\n  Returns a {@link LocalDate} with the specified era.\n  The year-of-era and month will be unchanged.

Other date and time fields,\n * such as day-of-year, day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.\n * Time is represented to nanosecond precision.\n * For example, the value '2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789' can be\n * stored in a {@link LocalDateTime}.\n *\n * This class does not store or represent a time-zone.\n * Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays, combined with\n * the local time as seen on a wall clock.\n * It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information\n * such as an offset or time-zone.\n *\n * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today\n * in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar\n * system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.\n * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.\n * However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them\n * to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.\n *\n * ### Static properties of Class {@link LocalTime}\n *\n * LocalDateTime.MIN\n *\n * The minimum supported {@link LocalDateTime}, '-999999999-01-01T00:00:00'.\n * This is the local date-time of midnight at the start of the minimum date.\n * This combines {@link LocalDate#MIN} and {@link LocalTime#MIN}.\n * This could be used by an application as a 'far past' date-time.\n *\n * LocalDateTime.MAX\n *\n * The maximum supported {@link LocalDateTime}, '+999999999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999'.\n * This is the local date-time just before midnight at the end of the maximum date.\n * This combines {@link LocalDate#MAX} and {@link LocalTime#MAX}.\n * This could be used by an application as a 'far future' date-time.\n *\n */\nexport class LocalDateTime extends ChronoLocalDateTime\n/** extends ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>\nimplements Temporal, TemporalAdjuster, Serializable */ {\n\n\n    /**\n     * Obtains the current date-time from from the specified clock or the system clock in the specified time-zone.\n     *\n     * If the argument is an instance of Clock this will query the specified clock to obtain the current date-time.\n     * Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.\n     * The alternate clock may be introduced using dependency injection.\n     *\n     * If the argument is an instance of ZoneId this will query the system clock (see {@link Clock#system}) to obtain the current date-time.\n     * Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.\n     *\n     * If nor argument is applied, the system default time zone is used to obtain the current date-time.\n     *\n     * Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing\n     * because the clock is hard-coded.\n     *\n     * @param {Clock|ZoneId} clockOrZone -

The start and end points are this and the specified temporal. The end point is converted to be of the same type as the start point if different. The result will be negative if the end is before the start. For example, the amount in hours between two temporal objects can be calculated using `startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)`.\n\nThe calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of complete units between the two temporals. For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29 will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.\n\nThere are two equivalent ways of using this method. The first is to invoke this method directly. The second is to use `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)`:\n\n<pre>\n   // these two lines are equivalent\n   temporal = start.until(end, unit);\n   temporal = unit.between(start, end);\n</pre>\n\nThe choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.\nFor example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to be calculated:\n\n<pre>\n  daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);\n  // or alternatively\n  daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);\n</pre>\n\n### Implementation Requirements:\nImplementations must begin by checking to ensure that the input temporal object is of the same observable type as the implementation. They must then perform the calculation for all instances of {@link ChronoUnit}. An {@link UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown for {@link ChronoUnit} instances that are unsupported.\nIf the unit is not a {@link ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method is obtained by invoking `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)` passing this as the first argument and the converted input temporal as the second argument.\n\nIn summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:\n\n<pre>\n  // convert the end temporal to the same type as this class\n  if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {\n    // if unit is supported, then calculate and return result\n    // else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units\n  }\n  return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);\n</pre>\n\nNote that the unit's between method must only be invoked if the two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by `getClass()`.\n\nImplementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this read-only method is invoked.",

By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time\n * is not straightforward. There are three cases:\n *\n * * Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal\n *   case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.\n * * Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically\n *   due to the spring daylight savings change from 'winter' to 'summer'.\n *   In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.\n * * Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically\n *   due to the autumn daylight savings change from 'summer' to 'winter'.\n *   In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.\n *\n * Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an\n * instant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.\n *\n * For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the\n * middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time\n * shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later\n * offset, typically 'summer' time.\n *\n * For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the\n * middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no\n * previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is\n * used, typically 'summer' time. Two additional methods,\n * {@link withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap} and {@link withLaterOffsetAtOverlap},\n * help manage the case of an overlap.\n *\n * ### Specification for implementors\n *\n * A {@link ZonedDateTime} holds state equivalent to three separate objects,\n * a {@link LocalDateTime}, a {@link ZoneId} and the resolved {@link ZoneOffset}.\n * The offset and local date-time are used to define an instant when necessary.\n * The zone ID is used to obtain the rules for how and when the offset changes.\n * The offset cannot be freely set, as the zone controls which offsets are valid.\n */\nexport class ZonedDateTime extends ChronoZonedDateTime {\n\n    //-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    /**\n     * Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the specified time-zone or clock\n     * or default time zone.\n     *\n     * This will query the system clock (see {@link Clock#systemDefaultZone}) in the default\n     * time-zone to obtain the current date-time.\n     * The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.\n     *\n     * Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing\n     * because the clock is hard-coded.\n     *\n     * @param {Clock|ZoneId} [clockOrZone=Clock.systemDefaultZone()]\n     * @return {ZonedDateTime} the current date-time using the system clock, not null\n     */\n    static now(clockOrZone) {\n        let clock;\n        if(clockOrZone instanceof ZoneId){\n            clock = Clock.system(clockOrZone);\n        } else {\n            clock = clockOrZone == null ?

    "description": "A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,\nsuch as `2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris`.\n\n`ZonedDateTime` is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.\nThis class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,\nand a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.\nFor example, the value\n'2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone'\ncan be stored in a {@link ZonedDateTime}.\n\nThis class handles conversion from the local time-line of {@link LocalDateTime}\nto the instant time-line of {@link Instant}.\nThe difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,\nrepresented by a {@link ZoneOffset}.\n\nConverting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the\n{@link ZoneRules} rules accessed from the {@link ZoneId}.\nObtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid\noffset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time\nis not straightforward. There are three cases:\n\n* Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal\n  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.\n* Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically\n  due to the spring daylight savings change from 'winter' to 'summer'.\n  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.\n* Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically\n  due to the autumn daylight savings change from 'summer' to 'winter'.\n  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.\n\nAny method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an\ninstant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.\n\nFor Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the\nmiddle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time\nshifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later\noffset, typically 'summer' time.\n\nFor Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the\nmiddle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no\nprevious offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is\nused, typically 'summer' time. Two additional methods,\n{@link withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap} and {@link withLaterOffsetAtOverlap},\nhelp manage the case of an overlap.\n\n### Specification for implementors\n\nA {@link ZonedDateTime} holds state equivalent to three separate objects,\na {@link LocalDateTime}, a {@link ZoneId} and the resolved {@link ZoneOffset}.\nThe offset and local date-time are used to define an instant when necessary.\nThe zone ID is used to obtain the rules for how and when the offset changes.\nThe offset cannot be freely set, as the zone controls which offsets are valid.",

The rationale for this is explored in the following documentation.\n *\n * The primary use case where this interface should be used is where the generic\n * type parameter `C` is fully defined as a specific chronology.\n * In that case, the assumptions of that chronology are known at development\n * time and specified in the code.\n *\n * When the chronology is defined in the generic type parameter as ? or otherwise\n * unknown at development time, the rest of the discussion below applies.\n *\n * To emphasize the point, declaring a method signature, field or variable as this\n * interface type can initially seem like the sensible way to globalize an application,\n * however it is usually the wrong approach.\n * As such, it should be considered an application-wide architectural decision to choose\n * to use this interface as opposed to {@link LocalDate}.\n *\n * #### Architectural issues to consider\n *\n * These are some of the points that must be considered before using this interface\n * throughout an application.\n *\n * 1) Applications using this interface, as opposed to using just {@link LocalDate},\n * face a significantly higher probability of bugs. This is because the calendar system\n * in use is not known at development time. A key cause of bugs is where the developer\n * applies assumptions from their day-to-day knowledge of the ISO calendar system\n * to code that is intended to deal with any arbitrary calendar system.\n * The section below outlines how those assumptions can cause problems\n * The primary mechanism for reducing this increased risk of bugs is a strong code review process.\n * This should also be considered a extra cost in maintenance for the lifetime of the code.\n *\n * 2) This interface does not enforce immutability of implementations.\n * While the implementation notes indicate that all implementations must be immutable\n * there is nothing in the code or type system to enforce this. Any method declared\n * to accept a {@link ChronoLocalDate} could therefore be passed a poorly or\n * maliciously written mutable implementation.\n *\n * 3) Applications using this interface  must consider the impact of eras.\n * {@link LocalDate} shields users from the concept of eras, by ensuring that `getYear()`\n * returns the proleptic year. That decision ensures that developers can think of\n * {@link LocalDate} instances as consisting of three fields - year, month-of-year and day-of-month.\n * By contrast, users of this interface must think of dates as consisting of four fields -\n * era, year-of-era, month-of-year and day-of-month. The extra era field is frequently\n * forgotten, yet it is of vital importance to dates in an arbitrary calendar system.\n * For example, in the Japanese calendar system, the era represents the reign of an Emperor.\n * Whenever one reign ends and another starts, the year-of-era is reset to one.\n *\n * 4) The only agreed international standard for passing a date between two systems\n * is the ISO-8601 standard which requires the ISO calendar system. Using this interface\n * throughout the application will inevitably lead to the requirement to pass the date\n * across a network or component boundary, requiring an application specific protocol or format.\n *\n * 5) Long term persistence, such as a database, will almost always only accept dates in the\n * ISO-8601 calendar system (or the related Julian-Gregorian). Passing around dates in other\n * calendar systems increases the complications of interacting with persistence.\n *\n * 6) Most of the time, passing a {@link ChronoLocalDate} throughout an application\n * is unnecessary, as discussed in the last section below.\n *\n * #### False assumptions causing bugs in multi-calendar system code\n *\n * As indicated above, there are many issues to consider when try to use and manipulate a\n * date in an arbitrary calendar system. These are some of the key issues.\n *\n * Code that queries the day-of-month and assumes that the value will never be more than\n * 31 is invalid. Some calendar systems have more than 31 days in some months.\n *\n * Code that adds 12 months to a date and assumes that a year has been added is invalid.\n * Some calendar systems have a different number of months, such as 13 in the Coptic or Ethiopic.\n *\n * Code that adds one month to a date and assumes that the month-of-year value will increase\n * by one or wrap to the next year is invalid. Some calendar systems have a variable number\n * of months in a year, such as the Hebrew.\n *\n * Code that adds one month, then adds a second one month and assumes that the day-of-month\n * will remain close to its original value is invalid. Some calendar systems have a large difference\n * between the length of the longest month and the length of the shortest month.\n * For example, the Coptic or Ethiopic have 12 months of 30 days and 1 month of 5 days.\n *\n * Code that adds seven days and assumes that a week has been added is invalid.\n * Some calendar systems have weeks of other than seven days, such as the French Revolutionary.\n *\n * Code that assumes that because the year of `date1` is greater than the year of `date2`\n * then `date1` is after `date2` is invalid. This is invalid for all calendar systems\n * when referring to the year-of-era, and especially untrue of the Japanese calendar system\n * where the year-of-era restarts with the reign of every new Emperor.\n *\n * Code that treats month-of-year one and day-of-month one as the start of the year is invalid.\n * Not all calendar systems start the year when the month value is one.\n *\n * In general, manipulating a date, and even querying a date, is wide open to bugs when the\n * calendar system is unknown at development time. This is why it is essential that code using\n * this interface is subjected to additional code reviews. It is also why an architectural\n * decision to avoid this interface type is usually the correct one.\n *\n * #### Using LocalDate instead\n *\n * The primary alternative to using this interface throughout your application is as follows.\n *\n * * Declare all method signatures referring to dates in terms of {@link LocalDate}.\n * * Either store the chronology (calendar system) in the user profile or lookup the chronology\n *   from the user locale.\n * * Convert the ISO {@link LocalDate} to and from the user's preferred calendar system during\n *   printing and parsing.\n *\n * This approach treats the problem of globalized calendar systems as a localization issue\n * and confines it to the UI layer. This approach is in keeping with other localization\n * issues in the java platform.\n *\n * As discussed above, performing calculations on a date where the rules of the calendar system\n * are pluggable requires skill and is not recommended.\n * Fortunately, the need to perform calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system\n * is extremely rare. For example, it is highly unlikely that the business rules of a library\n * book rental scheme will allow rentals to be for one month, where meaning of the month\n * is dependent on the user's preferred calendar system.\n *\n * A key use case for calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system is producing\n * a month-by-month calendar for display and user interaction. Again, this is a UI issue,\n * and use of this interface solely within a few methods of the UI layer may be justified.\n *\n * In any other part of the system, where a date must be manipulated in a calendar system\n * other than ISO, the use case will generally specify the calendar system to use.\n * For example, an application may need to calculate the next Islamic or Hebrew holiday\n * which may require manipulating the date.\n * This kind of use case can be handled as follows:\n *\n * * start from the ISO {@link LocalDate} being passed to the method\n * * convert the date to the alternate calendar system, which for this use case is known\n *   rather than arbitrary\n * * perform the calculation\n * * convert back to {@link LocalDate}\n *\n * Developers writing low-level frameworks or libraries should also avoid this interface.\n * Instead, one of the two general purpose access interfaces should be used.\n * Use {@link TemporalAccessor} if read-only access is required, or use {@link Temporal}\n * if read-write access is required.\n *\n * ### Specification for implementors\n *\n * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.\n * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.\n * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.\n *\n * Additional calendar systems may be added to the system.\n * See {@link Chronology} for more details.\n *\n * In JDK 8, this is an interface with default methods.\n * Since there are no default methods in JDK 7, an abstract class is used.\n */\nexport class ChronoLocalDate extends DefaultInterfaceTemporal {\n\n    isSupported(fieldOrUnit) {\n        if (fieldOrUnit instanceof ChronoField) {\n            return fieldOrUnit.isDateBased();\n        } else if (fieldOrUnit instanceof ChronoUnit) {\n            return fieldOrUnit.isDateBased();\n        }\n        return fieldOrUnit != null && fieldOrUnit.isSupportedBy(this);\n    }\n\n    query(query) {\n        if (query === TemporalQueries.chronology()) {\n            return this.chronology();\n        } else if (query === TemporalQueries.precision()) {\n            return ChronoUnit.DAYS;\n        } else if (query === TemporalQueries.localDate()) {\n            return LocalDate.ofEpochDay(this.toEpochDay());\n        } else if (query === TemporalQueries.localTime() || query === TemporalQueries.zone() ||\n                query === TemporalQueries.zoneId() || query === TemporalQueries.offset()) {\n            return null;\n        }\n        return super.query(query);\n    }\n\n    adjustInto(temporal) {\n        return temporal.with(ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY, this.toEpochDay());\n    }\n    /**\n     * Formats this date using the specified formatter.\n     *\n     * This date will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.\n     *\n     * The default implementation must behave as follows:\n     * <pre>\n     *  return formatter.format(this);\n     * </pre>\n     *\n     * @param {DateTimeFormatter} formatter  the formatter to use, not null\n     * @return {String} the formatted date string, not null\n     * @throws DateTimeException if an error occurs during printing\n     */\n    format(formatter) {\n        requireNonNull(formatter, 'formatter');\n        requireInstance(formatter, DateTimeFormatter, 'formatter');\n        return formatter.format(this);\n    }\n}\n",

For parsing, this will parse using the\nbase value of 2000, resulting in a year within the range 2000 to 2099 inclusive.\nIf the count of letters is less than four (but not two), then the sign is only output for negative\nyears as per `SignStyle.NORMAL`.\nOtherwise, the sign is output if the pad width is exceeded, as per `SignStyle.EXCEEDS_PAD`\n\n**ZoneId**: This outputs the time-zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'.\nIf the count of letters is two, then the time-zone ID is output.\nAny other count of letters throws `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\n**Zone names**: This outputs the display name of the time-zone ID.\nIf the count of letters is one, two or three, then the short name is output.\nIf the count of letters is four, then the full name is output.\nFive or more letters throws `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\n**NOTE**: since zone ids and name require the iana tzdb, they are currently not supported in js-joda!\n\n**Offset X and x**: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern letters.\nOne letter outputs just the hour', such as '+01', unless the minute is non-zero\nin which case the minute is also output, such as '+0130'.\nTwo letters outputs the hour and minute, without a colon, such as '+0130'.\nThree letters outputs the hour and minute, with a colon, such as '+01:30'.\nFour letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, without a colon, such as '+013015'.\nFive letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, with a colon, such as '+01:30:15'.\nSix or more letters throws `IllegalArgumentException`.\nPattern letter 'X' (upper case) will output 'Z' when the offset to be output would be zero,\nwhereas pattern letter 'x' (lower case) will output '+00', '+0000', or '+00:00'.\n\n**Offset Z**: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern letters.\nOne, two or three letters outputs the hour and minute, without a colon, such as '+0130'.\nFour or more letters throws `IllegalArgumentException`.\nThe output will be '+0000' when the offset is zero.\n\n**Optional section**: The optional section markers work exactly like calling\n{@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder.optionalStart} and {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder.optionalEnd}.\n\n**Pad modifier**: Modifies the pattern that immediately follows to be padded with spaces.\nThe pad width is determined by the number of pattern letters.\nThis is the same as calling {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder.padNext}.\n\nFor example, 'ppH' outputs the hour-of-day padded on the left with spaces to a width of 2.\n\nAny unrecognized letter is an error.\nAny non-letter character, other than '[', ']', '{', '}' and the single quote will be output directly.\nDespite this, it is recommended to use single quotes around all characters that you want to\noutput directly to ensure that future changes do not break your application.",

If the size of the value\nmeans that it cannot be printed within the width then an exception is thrown.\nIf the value of the field is negative then an exception is thrown during printing.\n\nThis method supports a special technique of parsing known as 'adjacent value parsing'.\nThis technique solves the problem where a variable length value is followed by one or more\nfixed length values. The standard parser is greedy, and thus it would normally\nsteal the digits that are needed by the fixed width value parsers that follow the\nvariable width one.\n\nNo action is required to initiate 'adjacent value parsing'.\nWhen a call to {@link appendValue} with a variable width is made, the builder\nenters adjacent value parsing setup mode. If the immediately subsequent method\ncall or calls on the same builder are to this method, then the parser will reserve\nspace so that the fixed width values can be parsed.\n\nFor example, consider `builder.appendValue(YEAR).appendValue(MONTH_OF_YEAR, 2)`.\nThe year is a variable width parse of between 1 and 19 digits.\nThe month is a fixed width parse of 2 digits.\nBecause these were appended to the same builder immediately after one another,\nthe year parser will reserve two digits for the month to parse.\nThus, the text '201106' will correctly parse to a year of 2011 and a month of 6.\nWithout adjacent value parsing, the year would greedily parse all six digits and leave\nnothing for the month.\n\nAdjacent value parsing applies to each set of fixed width not-negative values in the parser\nthat immediately follow any kind of variable width value.\nCalling any other append method will end the setup of adjacent value parsing.\nThus, in the unlikely event that you need to avoid adjacent value parsing behavior,\nsimply add the `appendValue` to another {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder}\nand add that to this builder.\n\nIf adjacent parsing is active, then parsing must match exactly the specified\nnumber of digits in both strict and lenient modes.\nIn addition, no positive or negative sign is permitted.",

years.\n *\n * When used with other calendar systems it must correspond to an integral number of days\n * and is normally an integral number of years.\n *\n * ChronoUnit.ERAS\n *\n * Unit that represents the concept of an era.\n * The ISO calendar system doesn't have eras thus it is impossible to add\n * an era to a date or date-time.\n * The estimated duration of the era is artificially defined as {Year.MAX_VALUE} + 1.\n *\n * When used with other calendar systems there are no restrictions on the unit.\n *\n * ChronoUnit.FOREVER\n *\n * Artificial unit that represents the concept of

However, it also defines an\n * alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year.\n *\n * The date is expressed using three fields:\n *\n * * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK} - the standard field defining the\n *   day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7)\n * * {@link WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year\n * * {@link WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week-based-year\n *\n * The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year.\n * It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.\n *\n * The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard\n * ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.\n *\n * * If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st\n * * If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year\n * * If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year\n * * If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year\n * * If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th\n * * If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd\n * * If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd\n *\n * There are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * * Sunday, 2008-12-28: Week 52 of week-based-year 2008\n * * Monday, 2008-12-29: Week 1 of week-based-year 2009\n * * Wednesday, 2008-12-31: Week 1 of week-based-year 2009\n * * Thursday, 2009-01-01: Week 1 of week-based-year 2009\n * * Sunday, 2009-01-04: Week 1 of week-based-year 2009\n * * Monday, 2009-01-05: Week 2 of week-based-year 2009\n *\n * ### Static properties of Class {@link IsoFields}\n *\n * IsoFields.DAY_OF_QUARTER\n *\n * The field that represents the day-of-quarter.\n *\n * This field allows the day-of-quarter value to be queried and set.\n * The day-of-quarter has values from 1 to 90 in Q1 of a standard year, from 1 to 91\n * in Q1 of a leap year, from 1 to 91 in Q2 and from 1 to 92 in Q3 and Q4.\n *\n * The day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the day-of-year, month-of-year and year\n * are available.\n *\n * When setting this field, the value is allowed to be partially lenient, taking any\n * value from 1 to 92. If the quarter has less than 92 days, then day 92, and\n * potentially day 91, is in the following quarter.\n *\n * IsoFields.QUARTER_OF_YEAR\n *\n * The field that represents the quarter-of-year.\n *\n * This field allows the quarter-of-year value to be queried and set.\n * The quarter-of-year has values from 1 to 4.\n *\n * The day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the month-of-year is available.\n *\n * IsoFields.WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR\n *\n * The field that represents the week-of-week-based-year.\n *\n * This field allows the week of the week-based-year value to be queried and set.\n *\n * IsoFields.WEEK_BASED_YEAR\n *\n * The field that represents the week-based-year.\n *\n * This field allows the week-based-year value to be queried and set.\n *\n * IsoFields.WEEK_BASED_YEARS\n *\n * The unit that represents week-based-years for the purpose of addition and subtraction.\n *\n * This allows a number of week-based-years to be added to, or subtracted from, a date.\n * The unit is equal to either 52 or 53 weeks.\n * The estimated duration of a week-based-year is the same as that of a standard ISO\n * year at 365.2425 days.\n *\n * The rules for addition add the number of week-based-years to the existing value\n * for the week-based-year field. If the resulting week-based-year only has 52 weeks,\n * then the date will be in week 1 of the following week-based-year.\n *\n * IsoFields.QUARTER_YEARS\n *\n * Unit that represents the concept of a quarter-year.\n * For the ISO calendar system, it is equal to 3 months.\n * The estimated duration of a quarter-year is one quarter of 365.2425 days.\n */\nexport class IsoFields {\n}\n\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nconst QUARTER_DAYS = [0, 90, 181, 273, 0, 91, 182, 274];\n\n/**\n * Implementation of the field.\n */\nclass Field extends TemporalField{\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {boolean}\n     */\n    isDateBased() {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {boolean}\n     */\n    isTimeBased() {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {boolean}\n     */\n    _isIso() {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @param {LocalDate} date\n     * @returns {ValueRange}\n     */\n    static _getWeekRangeByLocalDate(date) {\n        const wby = Field._getWeekBasedYear(date);\n        return ValueRange.of(1, Field._getWeekRangeByYear(wby));\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @param {number} wby\n     * @returns {number}\n     */\n    static _getWeekRangeByYear(wby) {\n        const date = LocalDate.of(wby, 1, 1);\n        // 53 weeks if standard year starts on Thursday, or Wed in a leap year\n        if (date.dayOfWeek() === DayOfWeek.THURSDAY || (date.dayOfWeek() === DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY && date.isLeapYear())) {\n            return 53;\n        }\n        return 52;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @param {LocalDate} date\n     * @returns {number}\n     */\n    static _getWeek(date) {\n        const dow0 = date.dayOfWeek().ordinal();\n        const doy0 = date.dayOfYear() - 1;\n        const doyThu0 = doy0 + (3 - dow0);  // adjust to mid-week Thursday (which is 3 indexed from zero)\n        const alignedWeek = MathUtil.intDiv(doyThu0, 7);\n        const firstThuDoy0 = doyThu0 - (alignedWeek * 7);\n        let firstMonDoy0 = firstThuDoy0 - 3;\n        if (firstMonDoy0 < -3) {\n            firstMonDoy0 += 7;\n        }\n        if (doy0 < firstMonDoy0) {\n            return Field._getWeekRangeByLocalDate(date.withDayOfYear(180).minusYears(1)).maximum();\n        }\n        let week = MathUtil.intDiv((doy0 - firstMonDoy0), 7) + 1;\n        if (week === 53) {\n            if ((firstMonDoy0 === -3 || (firstMonDoy0 === -2 && date.isLeapYear())) === false) {\n                week = 1;\n            }\n        }\n        return week;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @param {LocalDate} date\n     * @returns {number}\n     */\n    static _getWeekBasedYear(date) {\n        let year = date.year();\n        let doy = date.dayOfYear();\n        if (doy <= 3) {\n            const dow = date.dayOfWeek().ordinal();\n            if (doy - dow < -2) {\n                year--;\n            }\n        } else if (doy >= 363) {\n            const dow = date.dayOfWeek().ordinal();\n            doy = doy - 363 - (date.isLeapYear() ? 1 : 0);\n            if (doy - dow >= 0) {\n                year++;\n            }\n        }\n        return year;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {string}\n     */\n    getDisplayName(/*locale*/) {\n        return this.toString();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {null}\n     */\n    resolve() {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    name(){\n        return this.toString();\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nclass DAY_OF_QUARTER_FIELD extends Field {\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {string}\n     */\n    toString() {\n        return 'DayOfQuarter';\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {TemporalUnit}\n     */\n    baseUnit() {\n        return ChronoUnit.DAYS;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {TemporalUnit}\n     */\n    rangeUnit() {\n        return QUARTER_YEARS;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @returns {ValueRange}\n     */\n    range() {\n        return ValueRange.of(1, 90, 92);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @param {TemporalAccessor} temporal\n     * @returns {boolean}\n     */\n    isSupportedBy(temporal) {\n        return temporal.isSupported(ChronoField.DAY_OF_YEAR) && temporal.isSupported(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR) &&\n            temporal.isSupported(ChronoField.YEAR) && this._isIso(temporal);\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @param {TemporalAccessor} temporal\n     * @returns {ValueRange}\n     */\n    rangeRefinedBy(temporal) {\n        if (temporal.isSupported(this) === false) {\n            throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException('Unsupported field: DayOfQuarter');\n        }\n        const qoy = temporal.getLong(QUARTER_OF_YEAR);\n        if (qoy === 1) {\n            const year = temporal.getLong(ChronoField.YEAR);\n            return (IsoChronology.isLeapYear(year) ?

    "description": "Fields and units specific to the ISO-8601 calendar system,\nincluding quarter-of-year and week-based-year.\n\nThis class defines fields and units that are specific to the ISO calendar system.\n\n### Quarter of year\n\nThe ISO-8601 standard is based on the standard civic 12 month year.\nThis is commonly divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.\n\nJanuary, February and March are in Q1.\nApril, May and June are in Q2.\nJuly, August and September are in Q3.\nOctober, November and December are in Q4.\n\nThe complete date is expressed using three fields:\n\n* {@link DAY_OF_QUARTER} - the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92\n* {@link QUARTER_OF_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year\n* {@link ChronoField#YEAR} - the standard ISO year\n\n### Week based years\n\nThe ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format,\ndefining a string format for dates and times. However, it also defines an\nalternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year.\n\nThe date is expressed using three fields:\n\n* {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK} - the standard field defining the\n  day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7)\n* {@link WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year\n* {@link WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week-based-year\n\nThe week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year.\nIt differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.\n\nThe first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard\nISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.\n\n* If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st\n* If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year\n* If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year\n* If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year\n* If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th\n* If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd\n* If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd\n\nThere are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Sunday, 2008-12-28: Week 52 of week-based-year 2008\n* Monday, 2008-12-29: Week 1 of week-based-year 2009\n* Wednesday, 2008-12-31: Week 1 of week-based-year 2009\n* Thursday, 2009-01-01: Week 1 of week-based-year 2009\n* Sunday, 2009-01-04: Week 1 of week-based-year 2009\n* Monday, 2009-01-05: Week 2 of week-based-year 2009\n\n### Static properties of Class {@link IsoFields}\n\nIsoFields.DAY_OF_QUARTER\n\nThe field that represents the day-of-quarter.\n\nThis field allows the day-of-quarter value to be queried and set.\nThe day-of-quarter has values from 1 to 90 in Q1 of a standard year, from 1 to 91\nin Q1 of a leap year, from 1 to 91 in Q2 and from 1 to 92 in Q3 and Q4.\n\nThe day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the day-of-year, month-of-year and year\nare available.\n\nWhen setting this field, the value is allowed to be partially lenient, taking any\nvalue from 1 to 92. If the quarter has less than 92 days, then day 92, and\npotentially day 91, is in the following quarter.\n\nIsoFields.QUARTER_OF_YEAR\n\nThe field that represents the quarter-of-year.\n\nThis field allows the quarter-of-year value to be queried and set.\nThe quarter-of-year has values from 1 to 4.\n\nThe day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the month-of-year is available.\n\nIsoFields.WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR\n\nThe field that represents the week-of-week-based-year.\n\nThis field allows the week of the week-based-year value to be queried and set.\n\nIsoFields.WEEK_BASED_YEAR\n\nThe field that represents the week-based-year.\n\nThis field allows the week-based-year value to be queried and set.\n\nIsoFields.WEEK_BASED_YEARS\n\nThe unit that represents week-based-years for the purpose of addition and subtraction.\n\nThis allows a number of week-based-years to be added to, or subtracted from, a date.\nThe unit is equal to either 52 or 53 weeks.\nThe estimated duration of a week-based-year is the same as that of a standard ISO\nyear at 365.2425 days.\n\nThe rules for addition add the number of week-based-years to the existing value\nfor the week-based-year field. If the resulting week-based-year only has 52 weeks,\nthen the date will be in week 1 of the following week-based-year.\n\nIsoFields.QUARTER_YEARS\n\nUnit that represents the concept of a quarter-year.\nFor the ISO calendar system, it is equal to 3 months.\nThe estimated duration of a quarter-year is one quarter of 365.2425 days.",

Year, month and day-of-month are\n * simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.\n * See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.\n *\n * Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,\n * the {@link Chronology} and the {@link ZoneId}.\n * These can be accessed using the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQueries}.\n *\n * This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely\n * used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass\n * around instances of concrete types, such as {@link LocalDate}.\n * There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations\n * of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.\n * See {@link ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.\n *\n * ### When to implement\n *\n * A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:\n *\n * * it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per {@link TemporalAccessor}\n * * the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest\n * * the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the\n *   valid range of values for the fields that are represented\n *\n * Four examples make this clear:\n *\n * * {@link LocalDate} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n *   that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine\n *   the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.\n * * {@link LocalTime} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n *   that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine\n *   validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.\n * * {@link MonthDay}, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement\n *   this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,\n *   the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values\n *   for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.\n * * The combination day-of-week and day-of-month (\"Friday the 13th\") should not implement\n *   this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps\n *   days to months.\n *\n * @interface\n */\nexport class Temporal extends TemporalAccessor {\n    /**\n     * Checks if the specified unit is supported.\n     * This checks if the date-time can be queried for the specified unit.

Year, month and day-of-month are\nsimple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.\nSee {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.\n\nTwo pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,\nthe {@link Chronology} and the {@link ZoneId}.\nThese can be accessed using the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQueries}.\n\nThis interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely\nused in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass\naround instances of concrete types, such as {@link LocalDate}.\nThere are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations\nof this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.\nSee {@link ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.\n\n### When to implement\n\nA class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:\n\n* it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per {@link TemporalAccessor}\n* the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest\n* the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the\n  valid range of values for the fields that are represented\n\nFour examples make this clear:\n\n* {@link LocalDate} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n  that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine\n  the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.\n* {@link LocalTime} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n  that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine\n  validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.\n* {@link MonthDay}, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement\n  this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,\n  the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values\n  for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.\n* The combination day-of-week and day-of-month (\"Friday the 13th\") should not implement\n  this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps\n  days to months.",

    "description": "Calculates the period between this temporal and another temporal in terms of the specified unit.\nThis calculates the period between two temporals in terms of a single unit. The start and end points are this and the specified temporal. The result will be negative if the end is before the start. For example, the period in hours between two temporal objects can be calculated using `startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)`.\n\nThe calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of complete units between the two temporals. For example, the period in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29 will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.\n\nThere are two equivalent ways of using this method. The first is to invoke this method directly. The second is to use `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)`:\n\n<pre>\n   // these two lines are equivalent\n   between = thisUnit.between(start, end);\n   between = start.until(end, thisUnit);\n</pre>\n\nThe choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.\nFor example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to be calculated:\n\n<pre>\n   long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);\n   // or alternatively\n   long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);\n</pre>\n\n### Specification for implementors\nImplementations must begin by checking to ensure that the input temporal object is of the same observable type as the implementation. They must then perform the calculation for all instances of {@link ChronoUnit}. A {@link DateTimeException} must be thrown for {@link ChronoUnit} instances that are unsupported.\nIf the unit is not a {@link ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method is obtained by invoking `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)` passing this as the first argument and the input temporal as the second argument.\n\nIn summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this code:\n\n<pre>\n  // check input temporal is the same type as this class\n  if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {\n    // if unit is supported, then calculate and return result\n    // else throw DateTimeException for unsupported units\n  }\n  return unit.between(this, endTemporal);\n</pre>\n\nThe target object must not be altered by this method.",

The week-of-year field\nis validated to ensure that the resulting week-based-year is the\nweek-based-year requested.\n<p>\nIn {@linkplain ResolverStyle#SMART smart mode}, all three fields are\nvalidated against their range of valid values.

The resulting date is calculated\nequivalent to the following three stage approach.\nFirst, create a date on the first day of the first week in the requested week-based-year.\nThen take the week-of-week-based-year, subtract one, and add the amount in weeks to the date.\nFinally, adjust to the correct day-of-week within the localized week.",

It provides a **simple, domain-driven and clean API** based on the ISO calendar system, which is the de facto world calendar following the proleptic Gregorian rules.\n\n- js-joda has a lightweight footprint, only **43 kB minified and compressed**, no third party dependencies.\n\n- js-joda is **fast**. It is about 2 to 10 times faster than other JavaScript date libraries.\n\n- js-joda comes with built-in parsers/ formatters for ISO 8601 as specified in RFC 3339, that can be easily customized.\n\n- js-joda supports **ECMAScript 5** browsers down to IE9.\n\n- js-joda is a **port of the threeten** backport, which is the base for JSR-310 implementation of the Java SE 8 java.time package. Threeten is inspired by **Joda-Time**, having similar concepts and the same author.\n\n- js-joda is **robust and stable**. We ported more then 1700 test-cases with a lots of test-permutations from the threetenbp project. We run the automated karma test-suite against Firefox, Chrome, Node and phantomjs.\n\n## Why yet another javascript date and time library\n\n- Popular javascript date libraries like moment or date-utils are wrappers around the native javascript Date object,\n  providing syntactic sugar. The native Date object always consist of a date, time and a timezone part.\n  In opposite to that, js-joda is a standalone date and time implementation.\n\n- The API has a domain-driven design with classes for the different use cases, like LocalDate, ZonedDateTime or Period.\n  For examples LocalDate allows to handle dates like birthdays or holidays in a clean and error-safe way,\n  especially if these dates are persisted to an external server.\n\n- js-joda is immutable. Immutability aligns well with pure functions and\n  with the architecture of frameworks like React and Flux.\n\n## The threeten domain models\n\n### Dates and Times\n\n- **LocalDate** represents a date without a time and time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as 2007-12-24.\n\n- **LocalTime** represents a time without time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system such as '11:55:00'.\n\n- **LocalDateTime** is a description of the date (LocalDate), as used for birthdays, combined with the local time (LocalTime) as seen on a wall clock.\n\n- **ZonedDateTime** is a date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as 2007-12-24T16:15:30+01:00 UTC+01:00.\n\n- **Instant** is an instantaneous point on the time-line measured from the epoch of _1970-01-01T00:00:00Z_ in epoch-seconds and nanosecond-of-second.\n\n### Duration and Period\n\n- **Duration** is a time-based amount of time, such as '34.5 seconds'.\n\n- **Period** is a date-based amount of time in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as '2 years, 3 months and 4 days'.\n\n### Additional value types\n\n- **Year** represents a year in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as '2016'.\n\n- **YearMonth** represents a year and a month in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as '2016-01'.\n\n- **Month** represents a month-of-year in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as 'July'.\n\n- **MonthDay** represents a month-day in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as '--12-03'. Could be used to represent e.g. Birthdays.\n\n- **DayOfWeek** represents a day-of-week in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as 'Tuesday'.\n",

    "name": "./esdoc/manual/ZonedDateTime.md",
    "content": "# ZonedDateTime\n\nA `ZonedDateTime` represents a date-time with a [time offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset) and/or a [time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone) in the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) calendar system.\n\nOn its own, `ZonedDateTime` only supports specifying **time offsets** such as `UTC` or `UTC+02:00`, plus the `SYSTEM` time zone ID.\n\n### The `SYSTEM` zone ID\n\nThe `SYSTEM` zone ID is a non-standard ID that is specific to `js-joda`. It represents the default time zone of the current JavaScript runtime. The JavaScript spec does not provide an API this; it only provides the system default time offset for a point in the timeline (`Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset()`).\n\nYou should not exchange `ZonedDateTime` instances using the `SYSTEM` zone ID between JavaScript environments (e.g. between server and client, or between two servers). The time offset on another machine won't necessarily be the same as yours. Before sending a `ZonedDateTime` to someone else, convert it to a fixed offset:\n\n```javascript\n// current time with default `SYSTEM`\nZonedDateTime.now().toString(); // e.g. 2016-03-18T12:38:23.561+01:00[SYSTEM]\n\n// converted to a fixed time offset\nZonedDateTime.now()\n  .withFixedOffsetZone()\n  .toString(); // e.g. 2016-03-18T12:38:23.561+01:00\n```\n\n### Working with time zones\n\nA **time zone** and a **time offset** are [not the same thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset#Time_zones_and_time_offsets). Some timezones change from standard time to [daylight savings time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) and back every year:\n\n- In the `Europe/Berlin` _time zone_, the _time offset_ is `UTC+2` during the summer, and `UTC+1` during the rest of the year.\n- In the `Africa/Lagos` _time zone_, on the other hand, the _time offset_ is `UTC+1` all year round.\n\nCalculations that might span time zones or daylight savings transitions need to reference the time zone, not just the offset.\n\nThe [js-joda-timezone](https://github.com/js-joda/js-joda-timezone) package provides bindings to the the [IANA tz database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), making `joda-js`'s calculations time zone aware. The `tz` database uses zone names like `Africa/Bujumbura`, `America/New_York`, and `Europe/Lisbon` (see the [full list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)).\n\nTo specify time zones using these names, you just need to `require` [js-joda-timezone](https://github.com/js-joda/js-joda-timezone).\n\n```javascript\nvar jsJoda = require(\"@js-joda/core\");\nrequire(\"@js-joda/timezone\");\n\nvar zdt = ZonedDateTime.now(ZoneId.of(\"Europe/Paris\"));\n```\n\n### Create a ZonedDateTime\n\n```javascript\n// get now with the default system time zone\nZonedDateTime.now().toString(); // e.g. 2016-03-18T12:38:23.561+01:00[SYSTEM]\n\n// get now with the UTC time zone\nZonedDateTime.now(ZoneOffset.UTC).toString(); // e.g. 2016-03-18T11:38:23.561Z\n\n// get now with a fixed offset time zone\nZonedDateTime.now(ZoneId.of(\"UTC-05:00\")).toString(); // e.g. 2016-03-18T06:38:23.561-05:00[UTC-05:00]\n\n// get now with a ZoneRegion (requires `js-joda-timezone`)\nZonedDateTime.now(ZoneId.of(\"Europe/Paris\")).toString(); // e.g. 2017-02-04T17:01:15.846+01:00[Europe/Paris]\n\n// parse a date time with a time zone ISO String\nZonedDateTime.parse(\"2016-03-18T12:38:23.561+01:00[SYSTEM]\");\nZonedDateTime.parse(\"2016-03-18T12:38:23.561+01:00\");\nZonedDateTime.parse(\"2016-03-18T11:38:23.561Z\");\nZonedDateTime.parse(\"2016-03-18T06:38:23.561-05:00[UTC-05:00]\");\nZonedDateTime.parse(\"2017-02-04T17:01:15.846+01:00[Europe/Paris]\");\n\n// create from a LocalDate(Time) (requires `js-joda-timezone`)\nLocalDate.parse(\"2012-06-06\")\n  .atStartOfDay()\n  .atZone(ZoneId.of(\"Europe/Paris\")); // 2012-06-06T00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]\nZonedDateTime.of(\n  LocalDateTime.parse(\"2012-06-06T00:00\"),\n  ZoneId.of(\"Europe/Paris\")\n); // 2012-06-06T00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]\nZonedDateTime.of(\n  LocalDate.parse(\"2012-06-06\"),\n  LocalTime.MIDNIGHT,\n  ZoneId.of(\"Europe/Paris\")\n); // 2012-06-06T00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]\n\n// create from an Instant\nZonedDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.now(), ZoneId.SYSTEM); // current system time\n```\n\n### Switch time zones\n\n> These examples require `js-joda-timezone`.\n\n```javascript\nvar d = LocalDate.of(2016, 3, 18);\nvar zdt = d.atTime(LocalTime.NOON).atZone(ZoneId.of(\"America/New_York\")); //2016-03-18T12:00-04:00[America/New_York]\n\n// switch time zone retaining the local date-time if possible\nzdt.withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId.of(\"Europe/Berlin\")); // 2016-03-18T12:00+01:00[Europe/Berlin]\n\n// switch time zone and retain the instant\nzdt.withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId.of(\"Europe/Berlin\")); // 2016-03-18T17:00+01:00[Europe/Berlin]\n```\n\n### Get and manipulate values from a `ZonedDateTime`\n\n`ZonedDateTime` implements the same methods as `LocalDateTime` for getting or setting values. See [the examples above](#get-values-from-localdatetime) for `LocalDateTime`.\n\n### Calculate values across daylight savings transitions\n\nWhen adding to or subtracting from a `ZonedDateTime` instance, the calculation is different depending on whether date or time units are passed.\n\n- Addition/subtraction of **date units** are made on the **local** timeline.\n- Addition/subtraction of **time units** are made on the **instant** timeline.\n\nThis example shows the difference for a daylight saving transition.\n\n```javascript\n// assume the system default time zone is CET; we define a time as 2016-03-18 at 17:00 local time\nvar zdt = ZonedDateTime.parse(\"2016-03-18T17:00+01:00[Europe/Berlin]\");\n\n// adding a date unit of 2 weeks, crossing a daylight saving transition\nzdt.plusWeeks(2); // 2016-04-01T17:00+02:00[Europe/Berlin] (still 17:00)\n\n// adding a time unit of 2 weeks (2 * 7 * 24)\nzdt.plusHours(2 * 7 * 24); // 2016-04-01T18:00+02:00[Europe/Berlin] (now 18:00)\n```\n",

    "content": "# Formatting\n\nTo format a date and/or time, create a [`DateTimeFormatter`](../../class/src/format/DateTimeFormatter.js~DateTimeFormatter.html) and pass it to the `.format` method of a `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, or `ZonedDateTime` instance.\n\n```javascript\nconst d = LocalDateTime.parse('2018-04-28T12:34')\n\nd.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern('M/d/yyyy')) // 4/28/2018\nd.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern('HH:mm')) // 12:34\n```\n\n## Formatting with locales\n\nNon-numeric date and time formats need to know what language to use, for things like names of months and days of the week. For example, the format `eeee (d MMMM)` might return `Saturday (28 April)` in English, and `samedi (28 avril)` in French. If you try to use a locale-dependent format pattern without specifying the locale, you'll get this error message: \n\n```\nERROR: Pattern using (localized) text not implemented, use js-joda-locale plugin!\n```\n\nTo specify a locale, you'll need to import the [`js-joda-timezone`](/js-joda/js-joda-timezone) and [`js-joda-locale`](/js-joda/js-joda-locale) plugins. The simplest way to use `js-joda-locale` is to install one of the locale-specific builds from npm:\n\n- [@js-joda/locale_de](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_de)\n- [@js-joda/locale_de-de](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_de-de)\n- [@js-joda/locale_en](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_en)\n- [@js-joda/locale_en-us](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_en-us)\n- [@js-joda/locale_es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_es)\n- [@js-joda/locale_fr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_fr)\n- [@js-joda/locale_hi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_hi)\n- [@js-joda/locale_it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_it)\n- [@js-joda/locale_it-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_it-it)\n- [@js-joda/locale_zh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/locale_zh)\n\nYou can then use localized format strings as follows.\n\n```javascript\nimport 'js-joda-timezone' // Just needs to be imported; registers itself automatically\nimport { Locale } from '@js-joda/locale_fr' // Get `Locale` from the prebuilt package of your choice\nimport { DateTimeFormatter, LocalDateTime } from 'js-joda'\n\nconst d = LocalDateTime.parse('2018-04-28T12:34')\nconst formatter = DateTimeFormatter\n  .ofPattern('eeee (d MMMM)')\n  .withLocale(Locale.FRANCE)\nd.format(formatter) // samedi (28 avril)\n```\n\n**Note:** If internationalization is an important aspect of your application, you might consider using the standard [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat) API instead. It is built into modern browsers, supports a comprehensive set of locales, and handles a lot of internationalization subtleties that go beyond the scope of this library. To do this, you would need to convert your `js-joda` dates and times to JavaScript `Date` objects just before outputting them:\n\n```javascript\nconst ldt = LocalDateTime.parse('2018-04-28T12:34')\n\nconst jsDate = convert(ldt).toDate() // Convert to JavaScript `Date` object\n\nvar options = { \n  weekday: 'long', \n  year: 'numeric', \n  month: 'long', \n  day: 'numeric', \n  hour: 'numeric', \n  minute: '2-digit' \n}\n\njsDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', options) // Saturday, April 28, 2018, 12:34 PM \njsDate.toLocaleDateString('de-DE', options) // Samstag, 28. April 2018, 12:34\njsDate.toLocaleDateString('ar-EG', options) // السبت، ٢٨ أبريل ٢٠١٨ ١٢:٣٤ م\njsDate.toLocaleDateString('ko-KR', options) // 2018년 4월 28일 토요일 오후 12:34\n```\n\n\n## Format patterns\n\n\nDate and time formats are specified by date and time pattern strings using [Java SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html) codes.\n\n| Symbol | Meaning                    | Presentation | Examples                                       |\n| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| G      | era                        | number/text  | 1; 01; AD; Anno Domini                         |\n| u      | year                       | year         | 2004; 04                                       |\n| y      | year-of-era                | year         | 2004; 04                                       |\n| D      | day-of-year                | number       | 189                                            |\n| M      | month-of-year              | number/text  | 7; 07; Jul; July; J                            |\n| d      | day-of-month               | number       | 10                                             |\n| Q      | quarter-of-year            | number/text  | 3; 03; Q3                                      |\n| Y      | week-based-year            | year         | 1996; 96                                       |\n| w      | week-of-year               | number       | 27                                             |\n| W      | week-of-month              | number       | 27                                             |\n| e      | localized day-of-week      | number       | 2; Tue; Tuesday; T                             |\n| E      | day-of-week                | number/text  | 2; Tue; Tuesday; T                             |\n| F      | week-of-month              | number       | 3                                              |\n| a      | am-pm-of-day               | text         | PM                                             |\n| h      | clock-hour-of-am-pm (1-12) | number       | 12                                             |\n| K      | hour-of-am-pm (0-11)       | number       | 0                                              |\n| k      | clock-hour-of-am-pm (1-24) | number       | 0                                              |\n| H      | hour-of-day (0-23)         | number       | 0                                              |\n| m      | minute-of-hour             | number       | 30                                             |\n| s      | second-of-minute           | number       | 55                                             |\n| S      | fraction-of-second         | fraction     | 978                                            |\n| A      | milli-of-day               | number       | 1234                                           |\n| n      | nano-of-second             | number       | 987654321                                      |\n| N      | nano-of-day                | number       | 1234000000                                     |\n| V      | time-zone ID               | zone-id      | America/Los_Angeles; Z; -08:30                 |\n| z      | time-zone name             | zone-name    | Pacific Standard Time; PST                     |\n| X      | zone-offset 'Z' for zero   | offset-X     | Z; -08; -0830; -08:30; -083015; -08:30:15;     |\n| x      | zone-offset                | offset-x     | +0000; -08; -0830; -08:30; -083015; -08:30:15; |\n| Z      | zone-offset                | offset-Z     | +0000; -0800; -08:00;                          |\n| p      | pad next                   | pad modifier | 1                                              |\n| '      | escape for text            | delimiter    |\n| ''     | single quote               | literal      | '                                              |\n| [      | optional section start     |              |\n| ]      | optional section end       |              |\n| {}     | reserved for future use    |              |\n",
