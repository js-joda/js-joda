/**
 * Localized definitions of the day-of-week, week-of-month and week-of-year fields.
 * <p>
 * A standard week is seven days long, but cultures have different definitions for some
 * other aspects of a week. This class represents the definition of the week, for the
 * purpose of providing {@link TemporalField} instances.
 * <p>
 * WeekFields provides three fields,
 * {@link #dayOfWeek()}, {@link #weekOfMonth()}, and {@link #weekOfYear()}
 * that provide access to the values from any {@link Temporal temporal object}.
 * <p>
 * The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based
 * on the  {@link ChronoField#YEAR proleptic-year},
 * {@link ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR month-of-year},
 * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_MONTH day-of-month}, and
 * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK ISO day-of-week} which are based on the
 * {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY epoch-day} and the chronology.
 * The values may not be aligned with the {@link ChronoField#YEAR_OF_ERA year-of-Era}
 * depending on the Chronology.
 * <p>A week is defined by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The first day-of-week.
 * For example, the ISO-8601 standard considers Monday to be the first day-of-week.
 * <li>The minimal number of days in the first week.
 * For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days.
 * </ul><p>
 * Together these two values allow a year or month to be divided into weeks.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Week of Month</h3>
 * One field is used: week-of-month.
 * The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a month boundary.
 * The month is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.
 * The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days
 * and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.
 * <p>

 * <h3>Week of Year</h3>
 * One field is used: week-of-year.
 * The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a year boundary.
 * The year is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.
 * The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days
