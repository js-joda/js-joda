Year, month and day-of-month are\n * simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.\n * See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.\n *\n * Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,\n * the {@link Chronology} and the {@link ZoneId}.\n * These can be accessed using the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQueries}.\n *\n * This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely\n * used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass\n * around instances of concrete types, such as {@link LocalDate}.\n * There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations\n * of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.\n * See {@link ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.\n *\n * ### When to implement\n *\n * A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:\n *\n * * it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per {@link TemporalAccessor}\n * * the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest\n * * the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the\n *   valid range of values for the fields that are represented\n *\n * Four examples make this clear:\n *\n * * {@link LocalDate} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n *   that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine\n *   the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.\n * * {@link LocalTime} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n *   that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine\n *   validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.\n * * {@link MonthDay}, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement\n *   this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,\n *   the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values\n *   for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.\n * * The combination day-of-week and day-of-month (\"Friday the 13th\") should not implement\n *   this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps\n *   days to months.\n *\n * @interface\n ",
