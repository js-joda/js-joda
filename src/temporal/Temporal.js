/**
 * Framework-level interface defining read-write access to a temporal object,
 * such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.
 *
 * This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects that
 * are complete enough to be manipulated using plus and minus.
 * It is implemented by those classes that can provide and manipulate information
 * as fields (see {@link TemporalField}) or queries (see {@link TemporalQuery}).
 * See {@link TemporalAccessor} for the read-only version of this interface.
 *
 * Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
 * These are modeled using {@link TemporalField} with the number held using
 * a `long` to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
 * simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
 * See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.
 *
 * Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
 * the {@link Chronology} and the {@link ZoneId}.
 * These can be accessed using the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQueries}.
 *
 * This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
 * used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
 * around instances of concrete types, such as {@link LocalDate}.
 * There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
 * of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
 * See {@link ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.
 *
 * ### When to implement
 *
 * A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:
 *
 * * it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per {@link TemporalAccessor}
 * * the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest
 * * the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
 *   valid range of values for the fields that are represented
 *
 * Four examples make this clear:
 *
 * * {@link LocalDate} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
 *   that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
 *   the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.
 * * {@link LocalTime} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
 *   that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
 *   validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.
 * * {@link MonthDay}, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement
 *   this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,
 *   the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values
 *   for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.
 * * The combination day-of-week and day-of-month ("Friday the 13th") should not implement
 *   this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps
 *   days to months.
